# Generative-Influence-Structures
Generation of social influence structures while on the move in social foragers

# Intro
This model's aim is to better understand the implications of a simple rule on the formation of influence structures: follow individuals who lead to good outcomes. To model this rule we enable a reinforcement learning algorithm for each individual in the group which reinforces/dongrades following behaviours. The outcome of this model is a following network which describes the influence structure in the group.
